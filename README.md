# GPU Parallel 2 Value Simulation

Python code for implementing a crude, oblivious, cycle based 2 value logic simulator. Uses DGL.ai and PyTorch packages. 
Explanation of simulator mechanisms commented in code. Does not run out of the package. Does not include graph/netlists for input.
Code was tested with the following versions for packages: DGL.ai (0.3.x), PyTorch (1.4.0a)
